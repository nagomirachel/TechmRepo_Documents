Security in Embedded Cache
========================

This web application demonstrates how security, cache level authentication and authorization, works in embedded mode in JDG 6.3.

* Author: Vijay Chintalapati

Prerequisites
-------------
1. JDK 1.6+
2. Maven 3.0
3. JBoss EAP 6.2+ 

Setup
-----
1. Ensure that you have the correct repositories available within the .m2/settings.xml of the incident development system
2. To build and package the webapp, run the command `mvn clean package -DskipTests` at the command prompt in the root directory of the project
3. To run the install and configuration commands, ensure that the local JBoss server is running in Standalone mode
4. To deploy the __security-domain__ that will be used for Authentication, run the command `mvn jboss-as:execute-commands`
5. To deploy the packaged webapp, run the command `mvn jboss-as:deploy`
6. Since we will be using __application-user.properties__ and __application-roles.properties__ files that come with a standard JBoss server installation at path: __$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration__, run the following commands from the bin folder of the server installation
		
   	# Add a user who will be a reader. A reader can only read from the cache and cannot
		# perform any operation that changes the state of the cache or its contents
		$JBOSS_HOME/bin> ./add-user.sh -a -u readerUser -p readerUserPass9! -r ApplicationRealm -g reader
		
		# Add a user who will be an admin. An admin can perform ALL possible operations on 
		# the cache
		$JBOSS_HOME/bin> ./add-user.sh -a -u adminUser -p adminUserPass9! -r ApplicationRealm -g admin
7. Restart the application server to ensure that additions to the files containing the users/roles will be picked up
8. Considering a very basic setup of the server, the application should now be accessible at the URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/jboss-secure-embedded-cache-quickstart/
9. To run the JUnit tests, that test the authentication and authorization of the cache thru the secured webapp, run the command `mvn test` while the JBoss EAP server is still running

Testing
-------
1. Log in as __readerUser__ when prompted for a login
2. Once successfully authenticated, using the form on the page presented to you, try adding a string Key/Value pair. Make a note of any messages displayed.
3. Now, log out <sup>1</sup> as __readerUser__ by using the link provided in the location of your browser OR by clicking on it: [http://logout@127.0.0.1:8080/jboss-secure-embedded-cache-quickstart/](http://logout@127.0.0.1:8080/secure-embedded-cache-quickstart/)
4. You will be prompted with a login again, at which point, click on __Cancel__ button
5. Now try logging in as __adminUser__ by clicking on the original URL (step 7 of Setup)
6. Repeat testing step #2. If you see the writes being permitted, go ahead and add 5 new entries and delete 2 of them as part of testing
7. Now logout as __adminUser__ using the URL provided in testing step #3 and in the same manner as described above
8. Log back in as __readerUser__ and verify that you see 3 entires in the cache. If Yes, the testing was a SUCCESS. While still logged in as __readerUser__, see if you could delete any entries from the cache and note any messages displayed

Unit tests
----------
There are prepared unit tests for this quickstart. To run them, run following command:

      mvn test -DserverHome=/path/to/server

References
----------
<b><sup>1</sup></b> The above shown log out steps work well with Firefox. If it doesn't work well in your environment, you have three choices to log in as a different user:

1. Start a new browser session  (applies to IE 6+)
2. Use another browser 
3. Kill/Start (restart) the browser
